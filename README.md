Movie Night Curator / Possible Date Night Curator (README.md WILL CHANGE)

Will be able to curate a list of about 3-5 good movies based on an input of feelings and an input of a few movie genres definitive of what user would want to view.

Possibly based on favorite genres, mood, random films (older, newer, international films)

Would help individuals to get experience with new genres

Possbibly implement a "Try something new" tab -> randomize film options or base selections on a small questionare and genres.

Also log the movies a user has seen so it doesnâ€™t show those movies as a choice for other movie nights. 

Would need a movie database (need to be able to hold international films as well)

Implement a "best snacks or dinners to eat" with certain movies depending on the time of the day user's suggestions are being curated for/set a "time to watch" so it reminds users and also sets foods to have for that time.
